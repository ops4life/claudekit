# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**claudekit** is a comprehensive Claude Code plugin for DevOps, SRE, and Platform Engineering workflows. It provides production-ready slash commands for infrastructure management, deployment automation, observability, and incident response across multi-cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Azure).

**Purpose**: Enhance DevOps productivity with guided workflows, best practices, and automated procedures for:
- Kubernetes operations and troubleshooting
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) management
- CI/CD pipeline creation and deployment strategies
- Monitoring, alerting, and SLO management
- Incident response and postmortem creation

## Plugin Architecture

### Plugin Configuration

**`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`**: Core plugin metadata including:
- Plugin name, description, version, and author
- Tags for discovery (devops, sre, kubernetes, terraform, etc.)
- License information

**`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`**: Marketplace configuration for distribution

### Command Organization

Commands are organized by DevOps workflow domain for intuitive discovery:

| Category | Focus Area | Command Count |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| `k8s/` | Kubernetes operations & troubleshooting | 3 |
| `terraform/` | Infrastructure as Code management | 3 |
| `cicd/` | Pipeline creation & deployment automation | 2 |
| `observability/` | Monitoring, alerting, SLOs | 2 |
| `incident/` | Incident response & postmortems | 1 |

### Command Structure

Each command follows a consistent, production-ready structure:

1. **YAML Frontmatter**: Metadata with concise description
2. **Requirements Section**: User inputs and prerequisites
3. **Structured Workflow**: Step-by-step guidance with best practices
4. **Multi-Cloud Support**: Examples for AWS, GCP, and Azure where applicable
5. **Safety Checks**: Validation, rollback procedures, and risk mitigation
6. **Output Templates**: Structured formats for deliverables
7. **Best Practices**: Security, reliability, and operational excellence guidelines

**Example Command Pattern**:
```markdown
---
description: Brief, actionable description (< 80 chars)
---

# Command Title

Requirements section defining inputs, prerequisites...

Workflow sections with:
- Clear numbered steps
- Multi-cloud code examples
- Safety validations
- Rollback procedures

Output format templates...

Best practices and operational guidance...
```

## Command Usage

Commands are invoked using the pattern: `/claudekit:<category>:<command>`

**Examples**:
- `/claudekit:k8s:deploy` - Guided Kubernetes deployment
- `/claudekit:terraform:plan-review` - Analyze Terraform plan
- `/claudekit:cicd:pipeline-new` - Create CI/CD pipeline
- `/claudekit:observability:alert-new` - Create monitoring alert
- `/claudekit:incident:postmortem` - Generate postmortem document

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Cloud Support

All infrastructure commands support AWS, GCP, and Azure with:
- Cloud-specific examples and CLI commands
- Provider-agnostic patterns where possible
- Best practices for each platform
- Cost optimization guidance per cloud

### 2. Production-Ready Focus

Every command emphasizes:
- Security-first approach (RBAC, secrets management, least privilege)
- Comprehensive validation and pre-checks
- Detailed rollback and recovery procedures
- Error handling and troubleshooting guidance
- Monitoring and observability integration

### 3. SRE Best Practices

Commands incorporate Site Reliability Engineering principles:
- SLO-based alerting and monitoring
- Error budget management
- Blameless postmortem templates
- Chaos engineering considerations
- Incident response frameworks

### 4. Guided Workflows

Each command provides:
- Step-by-step procedures
- Decision trees for complex scenarios
- Checklists for validation
- Reference commands and scripts
- Links to runbooks and documentation

## Development Workflow

### Adding New Commands

1. **Identify DevOps Domain**: Determine appropriate category (k8s, terraform, cicd, etc.)
2. **Create Command File**: Add `.md` file in relevant `commands/<category>/` directory
3. **Follow Structure**:
   ```markdown
   ---
   description: Clear, concise description
   ---

   # Command Title

   ## Requirements
   [User inputs, prerequisites]

   ## Workflow
   [Structured steps with examples]

   ## Output Format
   [Template for deliverables]

   ## Best Practices
   [Security, reliability guidance]
   ```
4. **Multi-Cloud Coverage**: Include examples for AWS/GCP/Azure where applicable
5. **Safety First**: Always include validation, rollback, and error handling
6. **Test Command**: Verify command works in Claude Code with sample inputs

### Extending Categories

To add a new command category:
1. Create new directory under `commands/` (e.g., `commands/networking/`)
2. Add category-specific commands following existing patterns
3. Update this CLAUDE.md documentation
4. Update README.md with new commands

## Command Design Principles

1. **Actionable**: Commands guide users through complete workflows, not just information
2. **Safe**: Include pre-checks, validation, and rollback procedures
3. **Comprehensive**: Cover common scenarios and edge cases
4. **Educational**: Explain why, not just what (best practices context)
5. **Consistent**: Follow established structure and formatting patterns
6. **Multi-Cloud**: Support major cloud providers where relevant
7. **Production-Ready**: Assume production use, emphasize reliability and security
8. **Professional Output**: NEVER include AI attribution signatures such as:
   - "🤖 Generated with [Claude Code]"
   - "Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
   - Any AI tool attribution or signature
   - Create clean, professional output without AI references

## Git Workflow

**Branch Strategy:**

- **CRITICAL**: ALWAYS commit to feature branches, NEVER directly to `main`
- Direct commits to `main` are blocked by branch protection workflows
- Use descriptive branch names: `feature/<description>`, `fix/<issue>`, `docs/<topic>`
- Create pull requests for review before merging to main
- Only PR merges and automated release commits are allowed on `main`

**Commit Message Format:**

Follow conventional commit format without AI attributions:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:** feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

**Examples:**

```
feat(k8s): add deployment validation command

Add comprehensive Kubernetes deployment workflow with pre-checks,
security validation, and multi-cloud support.
```

```
fix(terraform): correct cost calculation for GCP resources

Update pricing data for Compute Engine instances.
```

```
docs: update README with installation instructions
```

**Rules:**

- No AI attribution signatures in commits
- Use conventional commit format
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages

## Release Process

Releases are **fully automated** using [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/).

**How it works:**

1. When a PR is merged to `main`, semantic-release analyzes commits
2. Determines version bump based on conventional commit types:
   - `feat:` → **minor** version bump (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
   - `fix:` → **patch** version bump (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
   - `BREAKING CHANGE:` → **major** version bump (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)
   - `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:` → no release
3. Automatically:
   - Generates CHANGELOG.md
   - Updates version in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
   - Creates git tag
   - Creates GitHub release with notes
   - Commits changes back to `main`

**Configuration:**

- `.releaserc.json` - Semantic-release configuration
- `.github/workflows/release.yaml` - GitHub Actions workflow
- `.github/update-plugin-version.js` - Updates plugin.json version

**No manual steps required** - just use conventional commits and merge to `main` via PR.

## Technical Standards

### Security
- Never hardcode secrets or credentials
- Use cloud provider secret management (Secrets Manager, Key Vault, etc.)
- Enforce least privilege (RBAC, IAM policies)
- Scan for vulnerabilities (container images, dependencies)
- Network security (firewall rules, network policies)

### Reliability
- Health checks (liveness, readiness probes)
- Resource limits and requests defined
- High availability configurations (replicas, PDBs)
- Rollback procedures documented
- Monitoring and alerting configured

### Observability
- Structured logging (JSON format)
- Metrics in Prometheus format
- Distributed tracing support
- SLO-based alerting
- Dashboard links in alerts

### Infrastructure as Code
- Version control all configurations
- Use modules for reusability
- Tag all resources appropriately
- Remote state with locking
- Plan before every apply
